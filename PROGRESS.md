# Admin Panel Enhancements - Progress Tracker

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Installed dependencies (bcryptjs, slugify)
- [x] Updated Prisma schema (password, Category, Product enhancements)
- [x] Pushed schema to database
- [x] Created auth utilities (password hashing, slug generation)

## 🚧 In Progress
This is a large enhancement with many interconnected features. Due to the scope, I'm implementing in phases:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (CURRENT)
- [ ] Admin email/password authentication
- [ ] Superadmin stats API
- [ ] Category management APIs

### Phase 2: Enhanced CRUD
- [ ] Product management with new fields
- [ ] User management for Superadmin  
- [ ] Organization update API

### Phase 3: Admin Features
- [ ] Admin user management (within org)
- [ ] Admin category/product management

### Phase 4: Registration & Polish
- [ ] Registration forms
- [ ] Real-time dashboard updates
- [ ] Testing & verification

## Next Steps
I recommend we proceed in phases to ensure quality. Would you like me to:
1. **Continue with full implementation** (will take many steps)
2. **Focus on specific features** (e.g., just auth + product management)
3. **Implement a simplified version** first, then iterate

Please let me know your preference!
